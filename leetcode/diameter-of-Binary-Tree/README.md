## 📝 Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the **length of the diameter** of the tree.

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the length of the **longest path** between any two nodes in the tree.  
This path **may or may not pass through the root**.

📌 The length of a path between two nodes is defined by the **number of edges** between them.

## 📘 Examples

### Example 1:

```

Input: root = \[1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest path is \[4,2,1,3] or \[5,2,1,3], which has 3 edges.

```

### Example 2:

```

Input: root = \[1,2]
Output: 1

```

## 🔒 Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range **[1, 10⁴]**
- Node values are in the range **[-100, 100]**
